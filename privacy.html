        <p>This is the privacy notice of https://win.win/ referred to in this document as “Win Win”, "we", "our", or "us".</p>
        <br>
		<p>This website is operated by New Capital LT, UAB . We are registered in Lithuania under registration number 304696871, and our registered office is at Lvovo str. 13C – 5, LT-09313, Vilnius, Lithuania.</p>
        <br>
        <h4 class="green">A. INTRODUCTION</h4>
        <p>This is a notice to inform you of our policy about all information that we record about you. It sets out the conditions under which we may process any information that we collect from you, or that you provide to us. It covers information that could identify you (“personal information”) and information that could not.

        <ul class="numbers">
          <li>We regret that if there is any information in this Privacy Policy with which you disagree, your only recourse is to leave our website immediately.</li>
          <li>We take the protection of your privacy and confidentiality seriously. We understand that all visitors to our website are entitled to know that their personal data will not be used for any purpose unintended by them, and will not accidentally fall into the hands of a third party.</li>
          <li>We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of all information you provide to us.</li>
          <li>Our policy complies with Ireland law accordingly implemented, including that required by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</li>
          <li>The law requires us to tell you about your rights and our obligations to you regarding the processing and control of your personal data. To comply with this law, we therefore request that you read the information provided at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.knowyourprivacyrights.org">www.knowyourprivacyrights.org</a></li>

		<br>
        <p>THE BASES ON WHICH WE PROCESS INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</p>
        <br>
        <p>The law requires us to determine under which of six defined bases we process different categories of your personal information, and to notify you of the basis for each category.
If a basis on which we process your personal information is no longer relevant then we shall immediately stop processing your data.
If the basis changes then, if required by law, we shall notify you of the change and of any new basis under which we have determined that we can continue to process your information.
</p>

		<ul class="numbers">
		<li>Information we process because we have a contractual obligation with you
When you register to create an account on our website, buy a product or service from us, or otherwise agree to our terms and conditions, a contract is formed between you and us.
In order to carry out our obligations under that contract, we must process the information that you provide to us. Some of this information may be personal information.
We may use this information in order to:</li>



        <ul class="dotted">
          <li>promote products and services to you</li>
          <li>provide you with our services</li>
          <li>provide you with suggestions and advice on products, services and how to obtain the most from using them and our website</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
		<p>We process this information on the basis that there is a contract between us, or that you have requested we use the information before we enter into a legal contract.
Additionally, we may aggregate this information in a general way and use it to provide class information, for example, to monitor our performance with respect to a particular service we provide. If we use it for this purpose, you as an individual will not be personally identifiable.
We shall continue to process this information until the contract between us ends or is terminated by either party under the terms of the contract.</p>
    	<br>
        <li>Information we process with your consent
Through certain actions when otherwise there is no contractual relationship between us, such as when you browse our website or ask us to provide you with more information about our business, including our products and services, you provide your consent to us to process information that may be personal information.
Wherever possible, we aim to obtain your explicit consent to process this information, for example, by asking you to agree to our use of cookies.
Sometimes you might give your consent implicitly, such as when you send us a message by e-mail to which you would reasonably expect us to reply.
Except where you have consented to our use of your information for a specific purpose, we do not use your information in any way that would identify you personally. We may aggregate it in a general way and use it to provide class information, for example, to monitor the performance of a particular page on our website.
We continue to process your information on this basis until you withdraw your consent.
You may withdraw your consent at any time by instructing us at contact@win.win . However, if you do so, you may not be able to use our website or our services further.
</li>
		<br>
		<li>Information we process for the purposes of legitimate interests
We may process information on the basis there is a legitimate interest, either to you or to us, of doing so.
Where we process your information on this basis, we do after having given careful consideration to:
</li>

		<ul class="dotted">
          <li>whether the same objective could be achieved through other means</li>
          <li>whether processing (or not processing) might cause you harm</li>
          <li>whether you would expect us to process your data, and whether you would, in the round, consider it reasonable to do so</li>
          </ul>
         <br>
	   <p>For example, we may process your data on this basis for the purposes of:</p>
       <ul class="dotted">
          <li>record-keeping for the proper and necessary administration of our business</li>
          <li>responding to unsolicited communication from you to which we believe you would expect a response</li>
          <li>protecting and asserting the legal rights of any party</li>
          <li>insuring against or obtaining professional advice that is required to manage business risk</li>
          <li>protecting your interests where we believe we have a duty to do so.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
		<li>Information we process because we have a legal obligation
We are subject to the law; therefore, we must process your information in order to comply with statutory obligations.
For example, we may be required to give information to legal authorities if they so request or if they have the proper authorisation such as a search warrant or court order.
This may include your personal information.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>RETENTION PERIOD FOR PERSONAL DATA<p>
<br>
<p>Except as otherwise mentioned in this privacy notice, we keep your personal information only for as long as required by us:</p>
	<ul class="dotted">
          <li>to provide you with the services you have requested;</li>
          <li>to comply with other laws, including for the period demanded by tax authorities (this will typically be a period of 7 years);</li>
          <li>to support a claim or defence in court.</li>
          </ul>
         <br>
         <p>If have not purchased or otherwise used any of our services, your personal information may be deleted by deleting your account. </p>
